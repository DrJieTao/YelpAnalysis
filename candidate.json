hopes.", "For the seafood buffet at Rio and Caesars you pay an extra free.", "Considering my last Vegas buffet was anything but satisfying at the Mandalay Bay, Bacchanal was very good, The only problem is they have so much to choose from, you can't possibly try it all.", "I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking.", "I was nice and gave it 3 star just cause the experience might have had more to do with me than the buffet.", "Overall, it was enjoyable.", "Second of all, I didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they

restaurant in Vegas.....I'm sure there are places with better food, or a better wine list, but i'm willing to bet they are buried deep inside a hotel or a casino and no matter how much you dress them

buffets, hit up this place.", "No room for desert.", "that horrible Tabasco sauce that Hooters use is also used here....go to Buffalo Wild Wings instead or get the Spicy wings at the Albertsons

same kind of taste and style, which becomes boring after a while.", "The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain

without breaking the bank.", "It was good but not as awesome as their chocolate waffle we had the day before.", "The chinese food reminded me of a typical Chinese buffet, the sushi was sloppily made and rice was just bad, the miso marinated sea bass was way overcooked and had a weird texture because of it, the \"prime rib\" was tough and dry, the lamb chop was overcooked,  the crab legs were still partially frozen, and the oysters made me wonder if I was going to be spending time with the porcelain goddess later that night.", "Anyway, the food was mediocre at best, but the choices were so slim I was shocked.", "They are not as ambitious as Bellagio, so don't expect as much variety or as many of the fancier dishes.", "Con: Lack of beef dishes.", "I found the sandwich to be a good

sweet asian lady at the bar was really friendly and cool...sold me on the lobster special.", "They should remake the food selections ASAP\n\nPros:\n* Locating in Cosmopolitan\n* Their desert is the only thing good there\n* They put many of their food in small cup\\/pan\\/pot\n\nCons:\n* For the subpar food selection they offer right now, $40+\\/person is a ripoff (Don't come here if you like seafood, their selection is very limited; they use crab legs the same level as those in $15-$20 asian buffet places)\n* Most of their food doesn't taste like $40+ buffet, it was so plain and basic\n* Their ambiance\\/decor can be considered \"OK\" if it locates elsewhere not name Cosmopolitan, but for such an upscale trendy hotel like Cosmopolitan, Wicked Spoon should spend a little more money on the restaurant's \"vibe\"\n* Our waiter was discriminative.", "That being said, it is still serviceable French food and a worthy option if you are in a bind and looking for a nice restaurant at a

shrimp cocktail... and yes, I could barely move for about five hours and felt queasy during the final bite of some chocolate fudge...\n\nbut it was SO, so worth it.", "Conclusion: if you've had good

is not real caviar, but still tasty.", "Fantastic food, quick service!", "Some fantastically original offerings...some standard Ponderosa\\/OCB offerings...mainly mouthwatering, and more less worth
