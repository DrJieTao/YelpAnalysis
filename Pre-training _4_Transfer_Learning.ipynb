      "People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.\n",
      "The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.\n",
      "Recommendations, of course, are required!\n",
      "Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!\n",
      "With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.\n",

      "I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.\n",
      "I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.\n",
      "The decor is very simple but comfortable.\n",
      "The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.\n",
      "The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.\n",

      "If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.\n",
      "Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.\n",
      "Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.\n",
      "No thanks!!!\n",
      "This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!\n",
      "Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!\n",

      "We were then shooed inside.\n",

      "We left, never to return.\n",

      "I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.\n",
      "If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.\n",
      "Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.\n",
      "You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.\n",
      "However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.\n",
      "The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.\n",

      "The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.\n",
      "He offers subpar service and has no personality.\n",

      "Me and my girls will definitely go back.\n",
      "Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.\n",
      "I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.\n",
      "Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.\n",
      "I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.\n",
      "The food is great.\n",
      "Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.\n",
      "I heartily recommend.\n",
      "There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.\n",
      "Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.\n",
      "Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.\n",
      "Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.\n",
      "The pizza was pretty good and huge.\n",
      "The price very reasonable.\n",
      "We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.\n",
      "We got most of it back at home with us.\n",
      "I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.\n",
      "The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol\n",
      "No, really.\n",
      "I have eaten a lot of pizza here.\n",
      "La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.\n",
      "Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.\n",

      "I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.\n",
      "Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.\n",
      "I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!\n",
      "I lOVE THIS PLACE!\n",
      "Keep up the good work guys!\n",
