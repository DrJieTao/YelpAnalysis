    "Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs over space or time and the task is to predict a category for the sequence. In any event, a *sentence* can be considered as a **sequence of words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this problem difficult includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the sequences can vary in length;\n",
    "    - traditional ML methods, including CNN, can only deal with fixed-length inputs; \n",
    "- be comprised of a very large vocabulary of input symbols; \n",
    "    - thus we have to deal with the *curse of dimensionality*; \n",
    "- and may require the model to learn the long-term context or dependencies between symbols in the input sequence; \n",
    "    - so far no other ML models can deal with such dependencies.\n",

    "The problem that we will use to demonstrate sequence learning in this tutorial is the [IMDB movie review sentiment classification problem](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Each movie review is a variable sequence of words and the sentiment of each movie review must be classified - hence, the reviews are the *unit of analysis* in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly-polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a **positive** or **negative** sentiment. We are only playing with two sentiments here - of course you can have multi-class sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral, uncertain).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected by [Stanford researchers and was used in a 2011 paper](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf) where a split of **50-50** of the data was used for training and testing. An accuracy of **88.89%** was achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides access to the *IMDB dataset built-in* - which means you do not have to download and import the dataset. The imdb.load_data() function allows you to load the dataset in a format that is ready for use in neural network and deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the ordered frequency of each word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of integers."
